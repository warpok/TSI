\c 130
\s1 A psalm written for people going up to the temple to worship
\q1
\v 1 TUHAN, betapa aku ~merana/terpuruk/putus asa [~karena dosaku], bagai/serasa tenggelam di jurang yang dalam,
\q2  [~aku tak sanggup menolong diri sendiri] maka ~~aku memanggil-manggil Engkau.
\q1
\v 2 Dengarlah jeritanku minta tolong, ya Tuhan,
\q2 ~kasihanilah aku,
\b
\q1
\v 3 karena seandainya Engkau tak mengampuni,
\q2 semua orang pasti celaka.
\q1
\v 4 Namun, ~kutahu Engkau maha pengampun,
\q2 sebab itulah kami kagum dan hormat kepada-Mu.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh has said \add that he would help/rescue me\add*;
\q2 I trust what he said, and I wait eagerly for him to do that.
\q1
\v 6 I wait for Yahweh \add to help me\add*
\q2 more than watchmen wait for the light to dawn;
\q2 yes, I wait more eagerly than they do!
\b
\q1
\v 7 You my fellow Israelis, confidently expect that Yahweh \add will blessus\add*.
\q2 He will bless us because he faithfully loves us,
\q2 and he is very willing to save/rescue us.
\q1
\v 8 And he will save us Israeli people from \add being punishedfor\add* all the sins that we have committed.
