\q1
\v 4 Ya TUHAN-ku, Engkau sudah berikan kepada kami segala hukum-hukum-MU untuk kami taati dengan setia.

\v 10 Dengan seluruh hidupku, aku melayani Engkau,
\q2 jangan biarkan aku melanggar perintah-perintah-Mu.

\q1
\v 20 Sebab jiwaku seakan-akan berkeinginan kuat untuk mengenal aturan-aturan-Mu sepanjang waktu.
\q1
\v 21 Engkau mencela mereka yang sombong,
\q2 Engkau mengutuk mereka yang tidak taat kepada perintah-perintah-Mu.
\q1
\v 22 Jangan biarkan mereka terus menghina dan mencemooh aku,
\q2 \add aku mengajukan permohonan ini karena aku sudah menaati perintah-perintah-Mu.\add*
\q1
\v 23 Para penguasa berkumpul dan merancangkan rencana jahat untuk menyakiti aku,
\q2 tapi aku akan merenungkan aturan-aturan-Mu.
\q1
\v 24 Perintah-perintah-Mu menyenangkan aku,
\q2 \add mereka seakan-akan menjadi penasihat bagiku. \add*

\q1
\v 25 “Aku hampir mati,” pikirku,
\q2 “Sembuhkanlah aku seperti yang Engkau janjikan kepadaku.”
\q1
\v 26 Segala dosa dan perbuatanku sudah kuakui di hadapan-Mu, dan Engkau menjawab doaku,
\q2 ajarkanlah aku ketetapan-ketetapan-Mu.
\q1
\v 27 Ajarlah agar aku mengerti prinsip-prinsip-Mu,
\q2 dan aku akan menceritakan segala perbuatan-Mu yang ajaib.
\q1
\v 28 Aku merasa tertekan sampai kehilangan kekuatanku,
\q2 buatlah aku kuat kembali, seperti yang sudah Engkau janjikan.
\q1
\v 29 Jauhkanlah dari padaku jalan dusta,
\q2 dan berilah aku pengetahuan akan hukum-hukum-Mu..
\q1
\v 30 Aku sudah memilih jalan tentang kebenaran,
\q2 aku sudah memutuskan untuk hidup sesuai dengan hukum-hukum-Mu.
\q1
\v 31 TUHAN, kepada aturan-aturan-Mu aku berpegang teguh,

\q2 sebab di sanalah aku temukan kebahagiaan.
\q1
\v 36 Berilah aku keinginan untuk menaati ketetapan-ketetapan-Mu,
\q2 dan bukan keinginan untuk menjadi kaya.
\q1
\v 37 Jangan biarkan aku mencari perkara-perkara yang tidak memiliki nilai
\q2 dan ijinkan aku hidup sesuai dengan cara-Mu.
\q1
\v 38 Penuhilah janji-janji-Mu kepada hamba-Mu yang penuh pengabdian,
\q2 agar hamba-Mu memiliki rasa hormat terhadap Engkau.
\q1
\v 39 Jauhkanlah segala celaan yang menakutkan untukku,
\q2 sebab penghakiman dari-Mu baik bagiku!
\q1
\v 40 Sungguh aku sangat ingin menaati ketetapan-ketetapan-Mu,
\q2 ijinkanlah untuk aku terus hidup dalam kebenaran-Mu.
\b
\q1
\v 41 TUHAN, biarkanlah belas kasihan-Mu datang atasku,
\q2 dan selamatkanlah aku sesuai dengan janji-Mu.
\q1
\v 42 Sehingga aku bisa menjawab mereka yang mencela aku,
\q2 sebab aku percaya kepada perkataan-perkataan-Mu.
\q1
\v 43 Jangan biarkan mulutku mengucapkan apapun kecuali kebenaran,
\q2 sebab aku menaruh harapan kepada peraturan-peraturan-Mu.
\q1
\v 44 Aku akan mengikuti hukum-hukum-Mu
\q2 untuk selama-lamanya.
\q1
\v 45 Dan aku akan berjalan seperti orang yang bebas merdeka,
\q2 sebab aku mencari petunjuk-petunjuk-Mu.
\q1
\v 46 Kepada raja-raja akan aku beritakan kesaksian tentang perbuatan-perbuatan-Mu yg besar,
\q2 dan kesaksian-kesaksian itu tidak akan membuat aku dipermalukan.
\q1
\v 47 Perintah-perintah-Mu membawa sukacita bagiku,
\q2 dan aku menyukai perintah-perintah-Mu.
\q1

\q1
\v 119 You get rid of all the wicked people on the earth like [SIM] people throw away trash;

\q1
\v 120 I [SYN] tremble because I am afraid of you;

\b
\q1
\v 129 ◄Your requirements are/All the things that you have instructed us to do are► wonderful,
\q2 so I obey them with all my inner being.
\q1
\v 130 When someone explains ◄your words/what you have said►,
\q2 \add it is as though\add* they are lighting a light;
\q2 what they say causes even people who have not learned your laws to be wise.
\q1
\v 131 I eagerly desire to know ◄your commands/what you have commanded►,

\q1
\v 137 Yahweh, you are righteous
\q2 and ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us► are just/fair.
\q1
\v 138 ◄Your requirements/All the things that you have instructed us to do► are true
\q2 and are all very right and fair.
\q1
\v 139 I am ◄furious/very angry►
\q2 because my enemies disregard ◄your words/what you have told us to do►.
\q1
\v 140 ◄Your promises are/All the things that you have said that you will do are► dependable
\q2 and I love them.
\q1
\v 141 I am not important and people despise me,
\q2 but I do not forget ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►.
\q1
\v 142 You are righteous and you will be righteous forever,
\q2 and your laws will never be changed.
\q1
\v 143 I constantly have troubles/difficulties and I am worried,

\q1
\v 146 I call out to you;
\q2 save/rescue me in order that I \add can continue to\add* obey all ◄your requirements/the things that you have instructed us to do►.
\q1
\v 147 Each morning I arise before dawn and call to you to help me;

\q1
\v 148 All during the night I am awake,

\v 149 Yahweh, because you faithfully love me,
\q2 listen to me \add while I pray\add*
\q2 and keep me safe because of \add my obeying\add* ◄your regulations/what you have told us to do►.
\q1
\v 150 Those evil people who oppress/persecute me are coming closer to me;
\q2 they do not pay any attention to your laws.
\q1
\v 151 But Yahweh, you are near to me,
\q2 and \add I know that\add* ◄your commands/what you command► will never be changed.
\q1
\v 152 Long ago I found out about ◄your requirements/all the things that you have instructed us to do►,

\q1
\v 156 Yahweh, you are very merciful;

\q1
\v 157 Many people are my enemies and many people ◄cause me to suffer/persecute me►,

\q1
\v 158 When I look at those who are not faithful to you, I am disgusted

\q1
\v 159 Yahweh, notice that I love ◄your principles of behavior/what you have declared that we should do►;
\q2 because you faithfully love me, allow me to continue to live.
\q1
\v 160 All that you have said is truth,
\q2 and all ◄your regulations/the rules that you have given to us► will endure forever.
\b
\q1
\v 161 Rulers persecute me for no reason,
