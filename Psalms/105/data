\v 1 Bersyukurlah kepada TUHAN, dan beritahukanlah kepada orang lain bahwa Dia sangat hebat!
\p
\q2 Beritahukanlah kepada semua orang di dunia tentang perbuatan-perbuatan-Nya yang besar!
\q1
\v 2 Bernyanyilah bagi-Nya; bermazmurlah bagi Dia;
\q2 beritahukanlah kepada semua orang tentang perbuatan-Nya yang besar.
\q1
\v 3 Bersukacitalah semua orang yang menyembah Tuhan!
\q2 Dialah TUHAN Yang Mahakudus.
\v 4 Mintalah TUHAN untuk menolongmu dan memberimu kekuatan-Nya,
\p
\q2 dan teruslah mencari Dia!
\b
\p
\v 5-6 Engkau, orang-orang keturunan Abraham, hamba-Nya,
\p
\p Engkau keturunan Yakub, orang yang dipilih Tuhan,
\p
\p pikirkan tentang semua hal menakjubkan yang sudah Dia lakukan:
\p
\q2 Dia melakukan mujizat, dan Dia menghukum semua musuh kita.

\p
\v 8 Dia tidak pernah melupakan perjanjian yang Dia buat;
\p
\q2 Dia membuat janji yang akan bertahan selama-lamanya;
\v 9 itulah perjanjian yang Dia buat dengan Abraham,
\p
\q2 dan Dia mengulangi perjanjian itu dengan Isak.
\v 10 Kemudian Dia memastikannya lagi kepada Yakub
\p
\q2 sebagai perjanjian untuk bangsa Israel yang akan bertahan selamanya.
\v 11 Apa yang dia katakan adalah, “Aku akan memberimu wilayah Kanaan;
\p
\q2 itu akan menjadi milikmu dan keturunanmu selamanya. "

\q1
\v 12 \add He said that to them\add* when they were only a few of them,
\q2 a tiny group of people who were living in that land ◄like strangers/that belonged to other people►.
\q1
\v 13 They continued to wander from one place to another,
\q2 from one kingdom to another.
\q1
\v 14 But he did not others to oppress them.
\q2 He warned those kings by saying to them,
\q1
\v 15 “Do not do harm the people whom I have chosen!
\q2 Do not harm my prophets!”
\b
\q1
\v 16 He sent a famine to Canaan, and as a result all the people had no food to eat.
\q1
\v 17 So his people went to Egypt, but first he sent someone there.
\q2 He sent Joseph, who had been sold to be a slave.
\q1
\v 18 Later, while Joseph was in prison \add in Egypt\add*,
\q2 they put his legs in shackles that bruised his feet,
\q1 and they put an iron collar around his neck.
\q1
\v 19 There, Yahweh ◄refined Joseph's character/tested Joseph to see if Joseph would continue to trust him►,
\q2 until what Joseph predicted would happen ◄came true/happened►.
\q1
\v 20 The king of Egypt summoned him, and he set Joseph free;
\q2 this ruler of many people-groups released Joseph from prison.
\q1
\v 21 Then he appointed him to take care of everything in the king's household,
\q2 to take care of everything that the king possessed.
\q1
\v 22 ◄Joseph was permitted/He permitted Joseph► to command the king's servants
\q2 to do anything that Joseph wanted them to do,
\q2 and even to tell the king's advisors the things that they should do\add for the people of Egypt\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Later, \add Joseph's father\add* Jacob arrived in Egypt.
\q2 He lived like a foreigner in the land that belonged to the descendants of Ham.
\q1
\v 24 And \add years later\add* Yahweh caused the descendants of Jacob to become very numerous.
\q2 As a result, their enemies, \add the Egyptians\add*, considered that the Israelis were too strong.
\q1
\v 25 So Yahweh caused the rulers of Egypt to ◄turn against/hate► the Israeli people,
\q2 and they planned ways to get rid of his people.
\q1
\v 26 But then Yahweh sent his servant Moses
\q2 along with \add Moses' older brother\add* Aaron, whom Yahweh had also chosen\add to be his servant\add*.
\q1
\v 27 Those two performed amazing miracles among the people of Egypt,
\q2 in that land where the descendants of Ham lived.
\q1
\v 28 Yahweh sent darkness, so that the people of Egypt could not see anything [DOU],
\q2 but the rulers of Egypt refused [RHQ] to obey when \add Moses andAaron\add* commanded \add them to let the Israeli people leave Egypt\add*.
\q1
\v 29 Yahweh caused all the water in Egypt to become ◄blood/red like blood►,
\q2 and his doing that caused all the fish to die.
\q1
\v 30 Then he caused the land to become full of frogs;
\q2 the king and his officials even had frogs in their bedrooms.
\q1
\v 31 Then Yahweh commanded that flies come, and swarms of them descended on the people of Egypt,
\q2 and gnats also swarmed across the whole country.
\q1
\v 32 Instead of sending rain, Yahweh sent \add terrible\add* hail,
\q2 and lightning flashed throughout the land.
\q1
\v 33 The hail ruined their grapevines and fig trees
\q2 and shattered all the \add other\add* trees.
\q1
\v 34 He commanded locusts to come, and hordes/swarms of them came;
\q2 so many that they could not be counted.
\q1
\v 35 The locusts ate every green plant in the land,
\q2 ruining all the crops.
\q1
\v 36 Then Yahweh killed the oldest son in every house \add of the people ofEgypt\add* [DOU].
\b
\q1
\v 37 Then he brought the Israeli people out \add from Egypt\add*;
\q2 they were carrying heavy loads of \add jewelry made of\add* silver and gold\add that the people of Egypt had given to them\add*.
\q1 No one was left behind because of being sick.
\q1
\v 38 The people of Egypt were glad when the Israeli people left,
\q2 because they had become very afraid of the Israelis.
\q1
\v 39 Then Yahweh spread a cloud to cover the Israelis;
\q2 and \add at night it became\add* a big fire \add in the sky\add* to give them light.
\q1
\v 40 Later the Israelis asked for \add meat to eat\add*,
\q2 and Yahweh sent \add flocks of\add* quail to them,
\q1 and he gave them plenty of manna \add food\add* from the sky\add each morning\add*.
\q1
\v 41 \add One day\add* he caused a rock to open up and water [mengalir//poured out] \add for them to drink\add*;
\q2 it was like a river flowing in that desert.
\b
\q1
\v 42 He did that because he kept thinking about the sacred promise\add that he had given\add* to his servant, Abraham.
\q1
\v 43 So his people were joyful as he brought them out from Egypt;
\q2 these people whom he had chosen were shouting joyfully as they went.
\q1
\v 44 He gave to them the land that belonged to the people-groups\add that lived there in Canaan\add*,
\q2 and the Israelis harvested crops that other people had planted.
\q1
\v 45 Yahweh did all these things
\q2 in order that his people would do all the things that he had commanded them to do [DOU].
\b
\q1 Praise Yahweh/Hallelujah!
