\s1 Nyanyian pujian karya Asaf, untuk pemimpin paduan suara
\q1
\v 1 Berserulah memuji Allah yang menguatkan kita,
\q1 bersoraklah dengan riang bagi Allahnya Israel, Allah kita!
\q1
\v 2 Mari menyanyi bagi Dia. Pukullah rebana,
\q2 mainkan lagu yang [indah//merdu] dengan kecapi dan harpa.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Tiuplah terompet merayakan bulan yang baru,
\q2 mari kita berpesta gembira saat tiba purnama, penanda .
\q1
\v 4 Do that because that is a law for us Israeli people;
\q2 it is a command that God made for the descendants of Jacob.
\q1
\v 5 He gave it to the Israeli people when he punished the people of Egypt land.
\b
\q1 I heard someone [MTY] whose voice I did not recognize, saying,
\q1
\v 6 “\add After the rulers of Egypt forced you Israelis to work asslaves\add*,
\q1 I took those \add heavy\add* burdens off your backs,
\q2 and I enabled you to lay down those heavy baskets \add of bricks that you werecarrying\add*.
\q1
\v 7 When you were greatly distressed, you called out to me, and I rescued you;
\q2 I answered you out of a thundercloud.
\q2 \add Later\add* I tested \add whether you would trust me to giveyou\add* water \add when you were in the desert\add* at Meribah.
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 8 You who are my people, listen while I warn you!
\q1 I wish that you Israeli people would pay attention to what I\add say to you\add*!
\q1
\v 9 You must not have any idols of other gods among you;
\q2 you must never bow to worship any of them!
\q1
\v 10 Akulah TUHAN, Allah kalian;
\q2 Akulah yang membawa kalian keluar dari negeri Mesir,
\q2 Mintalah pada-Ku, Aku akan memenuhi semua kebutuhanmu.
\b
\q1
\v 11 But my people would not listen to me [SYN];
\q2 they would not obey me.
\q1
\v 12 So because they were very stubborn,
\q2 and I allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do.
\b
\q1
\v 13 I wish that my people would listen to me,
\q1 that the Israeli people would behave as I want them to do.
\q1
\v 14 \add If they did that\add*, I would quickly defeat their enemies;
\q2 I would strike/punish all of them [DOU].
\q1
\v 15 Semua orang yang membenci TUHAN terpaksa menyembah-Nya,
\q2 dan mereka akan dihukum untuk selama-lamanya.
\q1
\v 16 But I would give you \add Israelis\add* very good wheat/grain,
\q2 and I would fill your stomachs with wild honey.”
