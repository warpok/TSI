\c 116
\q1
\v 1 Aku mengasihi TUHAN,
\q2 karena Dia mendengar ketika aku berseru minta tolong kepada-Nya.
\q1
\v 2 Dia mendengarkanku,
\q2 itu sebabnya aku berseru minta tolong hanya kepada-Nya selama hidupku.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Segala sesuatu yang di sekelilingku membuatku berpikir bahwa aku akan mati,
\q2 aku sangat takut bahwa aku akan mati dan pergi ke dunia orang mati.
\q1 Aku sangat tertekan dan merasa takut.
\q1
\v 4 Tapi ketiak aku berseru kepada TUHAN,
\q2 “TUHAN, aku mohon selamatkanlah aku!”
\b
\q1
\v 5 TUHAN itu baik Yahweh is kind and does what is right;
\q2 he is our God, and he acts mercifully to us.
\q1
\v 6 He protects those who ◄are helpless/cannot defend themselves►;
\q2 and when I though that I would die, he saved me.
\b
\q1
\v 7 I must encourage/tell myself to ◄have inner peace/not worry anymore►,
\q2 because Yahweh has done very good things for me.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh has saved me [SYN] from dying,
\q2 and has kept/protected me from \add troubles that would cause meto\add* cry.
\q1 He has kept/protected me from ◄stumbling/being defeated►.
\q1
\v 9 So here on the earth, where people are still alive,
\q2 I live knowing that Yahweh is \add directing\add* me.
\q1
\v 10 I continued to believe/trust \add in Yahweh\add*,
\q2 even when I said, “I am greatly afflicted/troubled.”
\q1
\v 11 Even when I was distressed/worried and said, “I cannot trust anyone,”
\q2 \add I continued to trust in Yahweh\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 12 So now \add I will tell you\add* [RHQ] what I will offer to Yahweh,
\q2 because of all the good things that he has done for me.
\q1
\v 13 I will offer to him a cup \add of wine\add*
\q2 to thank him for saving/rescuing me.
\q1
\v 14 When I am together with many [HYP] people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.
\b
\q1
\v 15 Yahweh is very grieved/sad when one of his people dies.
\q1
\v 16 I am one of those who serve Yahweh;
\q2 I serve him like my mother did.
\q2 He has freed/saved me from dying (OR, from being fastened by chains).
\b
\q1
\v 17 So I will offer to him a sacrifice to thank him,
\q1 and I will ◄pray to him/continue to request that he [MTY] help me►.
\q1
\v 18-19 When I am together with many of [HYP] the people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 \add in the courtyard\add* outside his temple in Jerusalem,
\q2 I will give to him the offerings that I solemnly promised to give to him.
\b
\q1 Praise Yahweh!
