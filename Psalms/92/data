\c 92
\s1 Nyanyian untuk Hari Sabat
\q1
\v 1 Betapa [baiknya//indahnya] mengucap syukur kepada TUHAN
\q2 dan memuji-muji Engkau, ya Allah Yang Mahatinggi,
\q1
\v 2 memberitakan tentang kasih sayang-Mu setiap pagi,
\q2 dan menyanyikan tentang kesetiaan-Mu setiap malam,
\q2
\v 3 diiringi melodi kecapi
\q2 dan alunan nada gambus nan [syahdu//lembut].
\b
\q1
\v 4 Sebab Engkau, ya TUHAN, sudah membuat aku bergembira dengan hasil karya-Mu,
\q2 aku menyanyi dengan riang atas apa yang Kau buat.
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh, the things that you do are great!
\q2 But it is difficult for us to understand \add all\add* that you think.
\q1
\v 6 There are things \add that you do\add* that bebal people cannot know about,
\q2 things that stupid people cannot understand.
\q1
\v 7 They do not understand that although the number of wicked people increases\add like blades of\add* grass do [SIM],
\q2 and those who do what is evil prosper,
\q1 they will be completely destroyed.
\b
\q1
\v 8 But Yahweh, you will ◄be exalted/be honored/rule► forever.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh, your enemies will \add certainly\add* die,
\q2 and those who do wicked things will be defeated/scattered.
\q1
\v 10 But you have caused me to be as strong [MTY] as [SIM] a wild ox;
\q1 you have caused me to be very joyful [MTY].
\q1
\v 11 I [SYN] have seen you defeat my enemies,
\q2 and I have heard those evil men wail/scream while they were being slaughtered.
\b
\q1
\v 12 But righteous people will prosper like [SIM] palm trees that grow well,
\q2 or like [SIM] cedar trees that grow in Lebanon.
\q1
\v 13 \add They are like the trees\add* that grow near the temple of Yahweh\add in Jerusalem\add*,
\q2 the trees that are close to the courtyard of the temple of our God.
\q1
\v 14 Even when righteous people become old, they do many things [IDI]\add that please God\add*.
\q2 They remain strong and full of energy, \add like trees that\add* [MET] remain full of sap.
\q2
\v 15 That shows that Yahweh is just;
\q2 he is like a huge rock \add under which I am safe/protected\add*,
\q2 and he never does anything that is wicked/wrong.
