\q1
\v 1 TUHAN berkata kepada tuanku raja,
\q1 “Duduklah disini, dekat padaku, di tempat yang paling terhormat
\q2 sampai Aku selesai mengalahkan musuh-musuhmu
\q2 dan menjadikan mereka tempat pijakan untuk kakimu!”
\b
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh \add said to him\add*, “I will extend your power as king
\q2 from Jerusalem \add to other lands\add*;
\q2 you will rule over all your enemies.
\q1
\v 3 On the day that you lead your armies into battle,
\q2 many of your people will volunteer \add to join your army\add*.
\q1 Like the dew refreshes the earth early in the morning,
\q2 young men will \add encourage you by\add* coming to help you.”
\b
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh has made a solemn promise,
\q2 and he will never change his mind;
\q1 he has said to the king, “You will be a priest forever
\q2 like those who are in the line \add descended from\add* Melchizedek.”
\b
\q1
\v 5 Yahweh stands at your right side;
\q2 when he becomes angry, he will defeat many kings.
\q1
\v 6 He will judge and punish the people of many nations;
\q2 he will fill the \add valleys\add* with their corpses.
\q1 He will crush kings all over the earth.
\q1
\v 7 But the king will drink from the stream alongside the road;
\q2 he will be refreshed after defeating his enemies.
