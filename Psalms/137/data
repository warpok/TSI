\c 137
\q1
\v 1 Ketika kita dibawa sebagai tawanan ke Babilon, jauh dari Yerusalem,
\q1 kita duduk di tepi sungai di sana,
\q2 dan menangis mengenang Rumah TUHAN yang ada di Yerusalem di atas Bukit Sion.
\q1
\v 2 Di atas pohon dedalu di sepanjang sungai, kita menggantung harpa-harpa kita
\q2 \add sebab kita tidak ingin memainkan mereka karena kesedihan kita\add*.
\q1
\v 3 The \add soldiers\add* who had captured us \add and taken us toBabylonia\add* told us to sing \add for them\add*;
\q2 they told us to ◄entertain them/make them happy►, saying,
\q2 “Sing for us one of the songs \add that you previously sang in\add* Jerusalem!”
\q1
\v 4 But \add we thought to ourselves\add*,
\q2 “We \add are sad because we have been punished by Yahweh and brought tothis\add* foreign land,
\q2 so we cannot [RHQ] sing songs about Yahweh while we are here!”
\b
\q1
\v 5 If I forget about Jerusalem [APO], I hope/wish that my right hand will wither
\q2 \add with the result that I will be unable to play my harp\add*!
\q1
\v 6 I hope that I will not be able to sing again [MTY],
\q1 if I forget about Jerusalem,
\q2 if I do not consider that Jerusalem causes me to be more joyful than anything else does.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh, \add punish\add* the people of the Edom people-group
\q2 for what they did on the day that the army of Babylon captured Jerusalem.
\q1 Do not forget that they said,
\q2 “Tear down all the buildings! Destroy them completely! Leave only the foundations!”
\b
\q1
\v 8 And you people of Babylon, you will certainly be destroyed!
\q2 Those who punish you in return for what you did to us will be happy;
\q1
\v 9 they will take your babies
\q2 and completely smash them on the rocks.
