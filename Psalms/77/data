\c 77
\s1 Mazmur yang ditulis oleh Asaf untuk Yedutun, pemimpin paduan suara
\q1
\v 1 Aku berseru kepada TUHAN;
\q1 aku berseru dengan suara keras, dan Dia mendengarkanku.
\q1
\v 2 Ketika aku sedang tertekan, aku mencari TUHAN;
\q2 Sepanjang malam aku berdoa, dengan tangan terangkat ke surga,
\q2 tapi tidak juga aku merasa tenang.
\b
\q1
\v 3 Ketika aku ingat kepada Allah, aku merasa putus asa, sebab pikirku, Dia tidak akan pernah menolongku;
\q1 ketika aku merenung tentang diri-Nya, aku merasa kehilangan semangatku.
\qr (Coba pikirkan!)
\q1
\v 4 \add All during the night\add* he prevents me from sleeping;
\q2 I am very worried, with the result that I do not know what to say.
\q1
\v 5 I think about days that have passed;
\q2 I remember \add what happened in\add* previous years.
\q1
\v 6 I spend all the night thinking \add about things\add*;
\q2 I meditate, and this is what I ask myself:
\q1
\v 7 “Will the Lord always reject us?
\q2 Will he never again be pleased with us?
\q1
\v 8 Has he stopped faithfully loving us?
\q1 Will he not do for us what he promised to do?
\q1
\v 9 God promised to act mercifully toward us; has he forgotten that?
\q2 Because he is angry with us, has he decided to not be kind to us?”
\qr (Think about that!)
\q1
\v 10 Then I said, “What causes me to be very sad is that
\q1 \add it seems that\add* God, who is greater than any other god, is no longer powerful.”
\b
\q1
\v 11 But then, Yahweh, I recall/remember your great deeds;
\q2 I remember the wonderful things that you did in the past.
\q2
\v 12 I meditate on all that you have done,
\q2 and I think about your mighty acts.
\b
\q1
\v 13 God, everything that you do is holy;
\q2 there is certainly no god [RHQ] who is great like you are!
\q1
\v 14 You are God, the one who performs miracles;
\q2 you showed to the people of many people-groups that you are powerful.
\q1
\v 15 Dengan [kekuatan] tanganmu kamu menyelamatkan umatmu dari Mesir.
\q2 Engkau menyelamatkan mereka yang adalah keturunan Yakub dan anaknya yang tercinta, Yusuf.
\qr (diselingi musik)
\b
\q1
\v 16 \add It was as though\add* the waters \add of the Red Sea\add* saw you and became very afraid,
\q2 and even the deepest part of the water shook.
\q1
\v 17 Rain poured down from the clouds [PRS];
\q2 it thundered very loudly [PRS],
\q2 and lightning flashed in all directions.
\q1
\v 18 Thunder crashed in the whirlwind,
\q2 and lightning ◄lit up/flashed in► the entire sky [HYP];
\q1 the earth shook violently [DOU].
\q1
\v 19 Then you walked through the sea
\q2 on a path that you made through the deep water,
\q2 but your footprints could not be seen.
\b
\q1
\v 20 Ya TUHAN, gembalakanlah umat-Mu lagi
\q2 seperti waktu nenek moyang kami dipimpin oleh Musa dan Harun!
