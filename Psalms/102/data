\c 102
\s1 Doa yang ditulis oleh seseorang yang menderita, ketika dia putus asa dan memohon agar TUHAN menolongnya
\v 1 TUHAN, dengarkan doaku;
\p
\q1 dengarkanlah aku saat aku berteriak pada-Mu!
\v 2 Jangan sembunyikan wajah-Mu dariku pada waktu masalah menekanku
\p
\p Dengarkan aku,
\p
\q2 dan jawab aku dengan sekarang, saat aku memanggil-Mu!
\b
\p
\v 3 Hidupku berakhir, seperti asap yang menghilang;
\p
\q1 Tubuhku membara seperti api yang membakar.
\v 4 Rasanya mengering seperti rumput yang sudah diinjak-injak,
\p
\q2 sehingga tidak ada lagi keinginanku untuk makan.
\v 5 Aku mengerang dengan keras,
\q2 dan tulang saya terlihat di bawah kulit saya karena saya menjadi sangat kurus.
\q1
\v 6 I am like a \add lonely and despised\add* vulture in the desert,
\q2 like an owl by itself in the abandoned ruins \add of a building/city\add*.
\q1
\v 7 I lie awake \add at night\add*;
\q2 \add because there is no one to comfort me\add*,
\q2 I am like a lonely bird \add sitting\add* on a housetop [SIM].
\q1
\v 8 All during each day my enemies insult me;
\q2 those who make fun of me mention my name
\q2 \add and say, “May you be like him”\add* when they curse people.
\q1
\v 9-10 Because you are very angry [DOU] with me,
\q1 now \add I sit in\add* ashes \add while I am suffering greatly\add*;
\q2 and those ashes \add fall on\add* the bread/food that I eat,
\q2 and what I drink has my tears mixed with it.
\q1 \add It is as though\add* you have picked me up and thrown me away!
\q1
\v 11 My time \add to remain alive\add* is short,
\q2 like an evening shadow \add that will soon be gone\add* [SIM].
\q2 I am withering like grass withers \add in the hot sun\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 12 But Yahweh, you are our king who rules [MTY] forever;
\q1 people who are not yet born will remember you.
\q1
\v 13 You will arise and act mercifully toward \add the people of\add* [MTY] Jerusalem;
\q2 it is now time for you to do that;
\q1 this is the time for you to be kind to them.
\q1
\v 14 Even though ◄the city has been destroyed/our enemies have destroyed our city►,
\q2 we who serve you still love the stones that \add were formerly\add* in the city walls;
\q1 because now there is rubble everywhere,
\q2 we, your people, are very sad when we see it.
\q1
\v 15 Yahweh, \add some day\add* the people of other nations will have an awesome respect for you [MTY];
\q1 all the kings on the earth will see that you are very glorious/great.
\q1
\v 16 You will rebuild Jerusalem,
\q2 and you will appear there with your glory/brightness.
\q1
\v 17 You will listen to the prayers of your people who are homeless,
\q2 and you will ◄not ignore them/do what they request► [LIT]
\q2 when they plead with you to help them.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh, \add I want to\add* write these words
\q2 in order that people in future years \add will know what\add* you have done,
\q2 in order that people who are not born yet will praise you.
\q1
\v 19 They will know that you looked down from your holy/sacred place in heaven [DOU]
\q1 and saw \add what was happening on\add* the earth.
\q1
\v 20 They will know that you hear prisoners groaning
\q2 and that you will set free those who have been told, “You will be executed.”
\q1
\v 21 As a result, people in Jerusalem will praise you [DOU] for what you\add have done\add*
\q2
\v 22 when many people \add from other people-groups\add* and \add those who are citizens ofother\add* kingdoms gather to worship you.
\b
\q1
\v 23 \add But now\add* you have caused me to become weak while I am still young;
\q2 \add I think that\add* I will ◄not remain alive very long/soon die►.
\q1
\v 24 I say to you, “My God, do not take me away \add from the earth\add* now,
\q2 before I become old!
\q1 You live forever!
\q1
\v 25 You created the world long ago,
\q2 and you made ◄the heavens/everything in the sky► with your own hands.
\q1
\v 26 The earth and the heavens/sky will disappear, but you will remain.
\q2 They will wear out like clothes wear out.
\q1 You will get rid of them like \add people get rid of\add* old clothes,
\q2 and they will no longer exist,
\q1
\v 27 but you are \add not like the things that you created\add*,
\q2 \add because you are\add* always the same;
\q2 you never die.
\q1
\v 28 \add Some day\add* our children will live safely \add in Jerusalem\add*,
\q1 and their descendants will be protected in your presence.”
