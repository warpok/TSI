\c 31
\s1 Bangsa Israel diserang Orang Midian
\p
\v 1 TUHAN berbicara/berfiman kepada Musa/ku demikian,
\v 2 “Katakan kepada seluruh bangsa Islael bahwa mereka harus membalas perbuatan orang Midian yang telah bangsa Israel. Sesudah itu, engkau/Musa akan mati dan dikuburkan bersama dengan nenek moyangmu,”
\p
\v 3 Lalu Musa/aku berkata kepada orang Israel demikian, “Kumpulkanlah semua laki-laki yang siap berperang. TUHAN akan memperlengkapi mereka untuk melawan orang Midian atas perbuatan mereka atas bangsa kita.
\v 4 Pilihlah seribu orang dari tiap suku yang siap berperang.
\v 5 Kemudian setiap dua belas ribu laki-laki yang siap berperang dalam pertarungan, seribu orang dai tiap suku.
\v 6 Musa/Aku mengutus mereka ke medan perang, sementara itu Pinehas, anak laki-laki imam Eliazer membawa perlengkapan kudus sambil meniupkan nafiri sebagai tanda perang.
\p
\v 7 Kemudian mereka berperang melawan tentara Midian, seperti yang sudah diFirmanakan TUHAN kepadaku/Musa untuk dilakukan, yaitu, mereka harus membunuh setiap laki-laki orang Midian.
\v 8 Dalam peperangan itu, mereka berhasil membunuh banyak orang termasuk diantaranya lima orang raja dari sekitar Midian yaitu, Ewi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, dan Reba. Mereka juga membunuh Bileam, anak/putra Beor dengan pedang.
\v 9 Mereka berhasil menangkap perempua-peremuan dan anak-anak orang Midian, juga semua hewan ternak, kawanan domba-domba dan seluruh kekayaan/harta benda mereka dibawa/dijarah.
\v 10 Seluruh rumah-rumah dalam kota dan perkemahan milik orang Midian dibakar habis,
\v 11 tetapi semua perempuan dan anak-anak serta hewan-hewan peliharaan termasuk segala harta kekayaannya.
\v 12 Mereka membawa semuanya itu kepada Eliazer dan Musa/aku, dan kepada seluruh/segenap bangsa Israel yang sedang berada di perkemahan yang terletask di dataran yang didiami orang Moab dekat Sungai Yordan, seberang Kota Yerikho.
\v 13 Imam Eliazer dan semua pemimpan Eleazar usa/aku keluar dari perkemahan untuk menyambut kedatangan mereka.
\v 14 Akan tetapi Musa/aku marah kepada beberapa orang yang baru saja kembali dari pertempuran itu, yakni kepada pemimpin pasukan But Moses/I was angry with some of the men who had returned from the battle. He/I was angry with the army officers and the men who were commanders of a thousand men and those who were commanders of a hundred men.
\v 15 He/I asked them, “Why did you allow the women to live [RHQ]?
\v 16 They are the ones who did what Balaam suggested and urged/persuaded our people to worship\add Baal instead of\add* Yahweh. As a result, Yahweh caused a plague to strike his people while they were at Peor.
\v 17 So, now you must kill all the boys of the Midian people-group, and also kill all the women who have had sex [EUP] with any man.
\v 18 Spare only the girls who are virgins [EUP]. You can keep them to be your\add wives or your slaves\add*.
\p
\v 19 All of you who have killed someone or touched the corpse of someone who was killed\add in the battle\add* must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and on the seventh day, you must\add perform the ritual to cause you\add* to become acceptable to God again.
\v 20 You must also wash your clothes and anything \add that you took to thebattle\add* that is made of leather or goat's hair or wood.”
\p
\v 21 Then Eleazar said to the soldiers who had returned from the battle, “This is what Yahweh has instructed Moses:
\v 22 You must put into a fire any gold or silver or bronze or iron or tin or lead things\add that you brought back from the battle\add*.
\v 23 Put everything that will not burn into the fire, and then they will be acceptable for you to use. But also sprinkle those things with the water that causes things and people to become acceptable to God. The things that\add would burn if you put them\add* in a fire, sprinkle them with that water.
\v 24 On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp.”
\s1 Dividing the captured goods
\p
\v 25 Yahweh also said to Moses/me,
\v 26 “Tell Eleazar and the leaders of the family groups that they must write down a list of all the goods, the women, and theanimals that were captured \add in the battle\add*.
\v 27 Then they must divide all those things between the men who fought in the battle and the rest of the people.
\v 28 From the men who fought in the battle, take one from every five hundred people and from every five hundred cattle and donkeys and sheep, to be a tax for me.
\v 29 Take these things to Eleazar to ◄be my share/belong to me►.
\v 30 And from the other things, take one item from every fifty. That includes people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. Give those things to the descendants of Levi who take care of my Sacred Tent.”
\v 31 So Eleazar and Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded.
\p
\v 32-35 There were 675,000 sheep, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 virgins that they had captured from the Midian people-group.
\p
\v 36 The men who fought in the battle took 337,000 sheep \add from thebattle\add*,
\v 37 and they gave 675 of them to Yahweh.
\v 38 They took 36,000 cattle and gave 72 of them to Yahweh.
\v 39 They took 30,500 donkeys, and they gave 61 of them to Yahweh.
\v 40 They took 16,000 virgins, and they gave 32 of them to Yahweh.
\p
\v 41 Moses/I gave to Eleazar all \add the animals\add* that had been given to Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded.
\p
\v 42-46 Moses/I separated what those who had fought in the battle received from what the other people received. The people had taken 337,500 sheep, 36,000 cattle, 30,500 donkeys, and 16,000 virgins,
\v 47 From what the people received, Moses/I took one from every fifty items and gave them to Yahweh. That included animals and people. As Yahweh commanded, he/I gave them all to the descendants of Levi who took care of the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 48 Then the army officers and those who commanded a thousand men and those who commanded a hundred man came to Moses/me.
\v 49 They said, “We, who are your servants, have counted the soldiers whom we command, and\add we found that\add* none of them ◄is missing/has been killed►.
\v 50 So \add to thank Yahweh for that\add*, we have brought to him a gift of the gold items that we found\add after the battle\add*: Gold arm bands and bracelets and rings and earrings and necklaces. We want/hope that this will enable us to be forgiven for our sins.”
\p
\v 51 Jadi Elieler dan Musa/aku meenerima semua barang-barang yang ditempa dan terbuat dari emas/mengandun emas.
\v 52 Berat total semua barang-barang itu adalah 420 pound/190 kilo gram.
\v 53 Setiap tentara mengambil hasil jarahannya masing-masing.
\v 54 Eliazer dan Musa/saya menerima barang-barang yang terbuat dari emas yang dibawa olrh pemimpin pasukan seribu dan pasukan seratus. Semua barang-barang itu ditaruh dalam Kemah Suci sebagai peringatan akan pertolongan TUHAN bagi mereka.
