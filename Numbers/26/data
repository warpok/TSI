\s1 Sensus yang kedua
\p
\v 1 Sesudah tulah itu, TUHAN berkata kepada Musa, Eleazar putra imam Harun,
\v 2 "Kamu harus mengadakan sensus untuk seluruh orang Israel berdasarkan keluarga masing-masing. Setiap laki-laki yang berumur dua puluh tahun ke atas, harus kamu catat untuk jadi tentara."
\v 3-4 Musa dan imam Eleazer melakukan seperti yang TUHAN perintahkan, yaitu mengumpulkan setiap laki-laki dari kelompok umur itu. Mereka berkumpul di daratan Moan, di tepi Sungai Yordan dekat Yerikho.

\v 52 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
\v 53 “Divide Canaan land among the tribes. Distribute the land according the number of people in each tribe that are on your lists.
