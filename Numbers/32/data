\s1 Suku-Suku di [bagian/sebelah] Timur Sungai Yordan
\p
\v 1 Orang-orang dari suku Ruben dan Gad memiliki hewan ternak yang sangat banyak. Mereka melihat bahwa tanah Yaezer dan Gilead tampak baik/cocok untuk memelihara ternak/kawanan ternak.
\v 2 Lalu pemimpin kedua suku itu datang menghadap Imam Eliazer dan Musa/ku, kata mereka/mereka berkata,
\v 3 “Kami memilki hewan/kawanan ternak yang sangat banyak.
\v 4 TUHAN telah menolong kami menaklukan/mendpatkan negeri/tanah ini dan itulah tanah/daerah yang sangat baik untuk memeliharan hewan ternak/memelihara kawanan ternak. add*—tanah itu terletak dekat Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, dan Beon
\termasu kota-kota sekitarnya\add*.
\v 5 Kata mereka lagi/Lanjut mereka: Apabila kami diperbolehkan/diizikan/tuan-tuan memperbolehkan kami memilik tanah ini, kami akan tinggal di sini dan jangan bawa kami ke seberang sungai Yordan.”
\p
\v 6 Musa/Aku menjawab kepada pemimpin-pemimpin kedua suku itu, “Ini tidak adil/tidak boleh terjadi di mana kalian tinggal di sini sementara saudara-saudaramu pergi berperang!
\v 7 Apakah kamu mau/hendak membuat tawar/hati bangsa Israel mejadi tawar/tidak mau menyeberang sungai Yordan, ke tanah yang dijanjikan TUHAN kepada kita.
\v 8 Nenek moyang kita sudah pernah melakukan hal yang sama/kesalahan yang sama, ketika mereka diutus dari Kadesh-Barnea untuk melihat tanah Kanaan.
\v 9 Ketika mereka sampai di lembah Eskol dan melihat/mengamati negeri itu, tetapi mereka menjadi tawar hati sehingga mereka kembali dengan membawa pesan/berkata, ‘Kita jangan masuk ke tanah yang sudah diberikan TUHAN kepada/bagi kita.’
\v 10 Sehingga TUHAN murka/marah kepada/terhadap mereka dan dia bersumpah demikian:
\v 11 ‘Bahwa/sesungguhnya, orang-orang yang keluar dari Mesir, yang berusia dua puluh tahun saja yang akan meilhat tanah yang sudah dijanjikan akan diberikan kepada Abraham, Isak, and Yakub,
\v 12 kecuali Kaleb anak Yefune dan Yosua anak Nun, karena mereka benar-benar/sungguh-sungguh percaya/mengikuti AKU/TUHAN. Selain dari itu, tidak ada dari bangsa Israel yang keluar dari Mesir akan melihat Kanaan, karena mereka sungguh-sungguh tidak percaya kepadaKU/perjanjianKu/kekuatanKU.
\v 13 Mereka membuat/membangkitkan amarah TUHAN terhadap bangsa Israel sehingga mereka harus mengembara So Yahweh was angry with the Israeli people, and \add as aresult\add* he has caused us to wander in this desert for forty years. Finally, all the people who had sinned against Yahweh\add by refusing to trust him\add* died, \add one by one\add*.
\v 14 And you are acting like your ancestors did! You sinful Israeli people are going to cause Yahweh to be more angry with you\add than he was with our ancestors\add*!
\v 15 If you stop trusting him, he will cause you and all your fellow Israelis to stay longer in the desert, and he will get rid of all of you!”
\p
\v 16 Then the \add leaders of the tribes of Reuben and Gad\add* said to Moses/me, “First we will build pens for our animals and build cities for our families here.
\v 17 Then our families will live in strong cities with walls around them, and they will be safe from the people who live in this land. Then we will get ready to fight battles. We will help the other Israelis to get land\add on the other side of the river\add*.
\v 18 We will not return to our homes until every Israeli has received some land.
\v 19 We will not take any land on the west side of the Jordan \add River\add*; our land will be here on the east side.”
\p
\v 20 So Moses/I told them, “\add I will tell you\add* what you must do. You must get ready to fight battles for Yahweh.
\v 21 You must cross the Jordan \add River\add* carrying your weapons.
\v 22 After Yahweh helps us to take that land \add from the people who livethere\add*, you will be permitted to return to your homes. You will have done what you have promised Yahweh and the Israeli people that you would do, and you may keep this land to be your own, given to you by Yahweh.
\p
\v 23 But if you do not do these things, you will be sinning against Yahweh, and he will punish you for\add that\add* sin.
\v 24 Now you can build cities for your families and pens for your animals, but after doing that, you must do what you have promised.”
\p
\v 25 The leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We will do what you have asked us to do [MTY], because you are our leader.
\v 26 Our wives and children and our cattle and sheep and goats will stay here in the cities of the Gilead area,
\v 27 but we will prepare to go to battle. We will take our weapons and go across\add the Jordan River\add* and fight for Yahweh, just as you, our leader, have said.”
\p
\v 28 So Moses/I gave instructions about them to Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of the Israeli tribes.
\v 29 Moses/I said to them, “If the men from the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan\add River\add* with you, in order to do what Yahweh desires and help you to take that land, give them the Gilead area to belong to them.
\v 30 But if they do not take their weapons and go with you prepared to fight, they will not receive this land. They will need to accept some land in Canaan, like the rest of you will do.”
\p
\v 31 The \add leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben\add* replied, “We will do what you have said and what Yahweh has said.
\v 32 We will cross the river into Canaan land, and we will do what Yahweh desires and be prepared for battle. But our landwill be \add here\add* on the east side of the Jordan \add River\add*.”
\p
\v 33 So Moses/I agreed to give that land to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to half of the tribe of Joseph's son Manasseh. That land was previously the land where Sihon, the king of the Amor people-group, ruled, and the land where Og, the king ofBashan \add region\add*, ruled, including its cities and surrounding land.
\p
\v 34 The people of the tribe of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
\v 35 Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
\v 36 Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran cities. Those were cities with strong walls around them. And they also built pens for their sheep.
\p
\v 37 The people of the tribe of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
\v 38 Nebo, Baal-Meon, and Sibmah cities. When they rebuilt Nebo and Baal-Meon, they gave new names to those cities.
\p
\v 39 The descendants of Manasseh's son Makir went to the Gilead\add region\add* and compelled the people of the Amor people-group to leave that area.
\v 40 So Moses/I gave Gilead to the family of Makir, and they started to live there.
\v 41 Jair, who was also a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured the small towns in that region, and he named them the Towns of Jair.
\v 42 A man named Nobah went and captured Kenath \add city\add* and the nearby towns, and then he put his own name to be the new name of that area.
