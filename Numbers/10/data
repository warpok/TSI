\s1 The silver trumpets
\p
\v 1Yahweh also told Moses/me,
\v 2 “\add Tell someone to\add* make two trumpets by hammering each one from\add one lump of\add* silver. Blow the trumpets to summon the people to come together and also to signal that they must movetheir tents \add to a new location\add*.
\v 3 If both trumpets are blown, it means that everyone must gather together at the entrance of the Sacred Tent.
\v 4 If only one trumpet is blown, it means that only the \add twelve\add* leaders of the tribes must gather together.
\v 5 If the trumpets are blown loudly, the tribes that are to the east\add of the Sacred Tent\add* should start to travel.
\v 6 When the trumpets are blown loudly the second time, the tribes that are to the south should start to travel. The loud blasts on the trumpet will signal that they should start to travel.
\v 7 When you want only to gather the people together, blow the trumpets, but do not blow them as loudly.
\p
\v 8 The priests who are descended from Aaron are the ones who should blow the trumpets. That is a regulation that will never be changed.
\v 9 When you fight against enemies who attack you in your own land, tell the priests to blow the trumpets loudly. I, Yahweh, your God, will hear that, and I will rescue you from your enemies.
\v 10 Also tell the priests to blow the trumpets when the people are happy, and at the festivals\add each year\add*, and at the times when they celebrate the new moon each month. Tell them to blow the trumpets when the people bring offerings that will be completely burned, and when they bring offerings to maintain fellowship with me. If they do that, it will help you to think about me (OR, help me to think about you).\add You must do that, because\add* I am Yahweh your God.”
