\c 19
\s1 Upacara penghapusan dosa
\p
\v 1 TUHAN berbicara kepada Musa dan Harun,
\v 2 “Inilah peraturan-peraturan lain yang Aku berikan kepada kalian. Katakan kepada orang Israel untuk membawa kepada kalian sapi muda berwarna merah yang tidak bercela dan belum pernah dipakai untuk membajak.
\v 3 Berikanlah sapi itu kepada Imam Eliaser, yang akan menyembelih sapi itu di luar perkemahan dan mengucurkan darahnya ke dalam baskom.
\v 4 Haruslah dia mencelupkan salah satu jarinya ke dalam darah dan memercikkannya sebanyak tujuh kali ke atas tanah di depan Kemah Suci.
\v 5 Lalu sapi muda itu haruslah dibakar dalam pengawasan Eliaser sampai habis tidak bersisa seluruhnya, mulai dari kulit, daging, darah bahkan sampai kotorannya.
\v 6 Kemudian Eliaser harus mengambil sebatang kayu aras, sebatang kayu hisop, dan benang merah, dan melemparkan mereka ke dalam api yang membakar sapi muda itu.
\p
\v 7 Selanjutnya haruslah dia mandi dan mencuci pakaiannya, baru sesudah itu dia bisa kembali ke perkemahan. Tetapi dia tidak boleh melakukan segala pekerjaan kudus sampai sore hari sebab dia dianggap seakan-akan najis.
\v 8 The man who burns the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe, and he will also be unacceptable to me until that evening.
\p
\v 9 Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must gather up the ashes of the cow and put them in a ◄sacred place/place that is acceptable to me► outside the camp. The ashes must be kept there for the people of Israel to\add use when they\add* mix it with water for the ritual to remove the guilt of sin.
\v 10 The man who gathers up the ashes of the cow must \add also\add* wash his clothes, and he\add also\add* will be unfit to do any more sacred work until that evening. That is a regulation that will never be changed. It must be obeyed by you Israeli people and by any foreigners who live among you.
\p
\v 11 All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 12 On the third day and on the seventh day \add after touching acorpse\add*, in order to become acceptable to me again, \add they must sprinkle onthemselves\add* some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will continue to be unacceptable to me.
\v 13 All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh's Sacred Tent. They will no longer be permitted to live among the Israeli people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.
\p
\v 14 There is another ritual that must be performed when someone dies inside a tent. All those who were inside that tent when that person died or who enter that tent will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\v 15 Any jars that are inside that tent that are not covered are not permitted to be used.
\v 16 If someone who is out in a field touches the corpse of someone who was murdered, or who died from natural causes, or if someone touches a bone from some human or touches a grave, that person will be unacceptable to me for seven days.
\p
\v 17 For someone like that to become acceptable to me again, some of the ashes from\add the cow\add* that was burned must be taken and put in a jar. Then some fresh water must be poured over the ashes.
\v 18 Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must take a stalk of\add a plant named\add* hyssop and dip it into the water. Then that person must sprinkle some of the water on the tent where that person died, on the things that are in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent. He must also sprinkle some of that water on any person who touched a human bone or who touched a person who died, or who touched a grave.
\v 19 On the third day and on the seventh day after that, the person who is acceptable to me must sprinkle some of that water on those who have become unacceptable to me. On the seventh day, the people who are performing that ritual to become acceptable to me again must wash their clothes and bathe. If they do that, on that evening they will become acceptable to me again.
\p
\v 20 If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me again by doing this, they will no longer be permitted to live among the Israeli people, because they have defiled my Sacred Tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the water that removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me.
\v 21 That is a law for the Israeli people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle that water on themselves must then wash their clothes. And anyone who touches that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that evening.
\p
\v 22 Anything and any person whom someone who has become unacceptable to me has touched will remain unacceptable to me until that evening.”
