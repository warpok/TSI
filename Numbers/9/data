\s1 They celebrated Passover again
\p
\v 1 One year after the Israelis left Egypt, during the month of March, while they were in the Sinai Desert, Yahweh said to Moses/me,
\v 2 “Tell the Israeli people that they must celebrate the Passover\add Festival again\add*.
\v 3 They must do it on the fourteenth day of this month, early in the evening, and they must obey all the instructions aboutit \add that I gave you previously\add*.”
\p
\v 4 So Moses/I told the people what Yahweh had said about celebrating the Passover.
\v 5 The people celebrated it, there in the Sinai Desert, in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses/me.
\p
\v 6 But some of the Israeli people had touched a corpse, and as a result they had become unfit to celebrate the Passover. So they asked Aaron and Moses/me,
\v 7 “It is true that we have touched a corpse. But why should that prevent us from celebrating the Passover Festival and offering sacrifices to Yahweh like everyone else [RHQ]?”
\p
\v 8 Moses/I replied, “Wait here until I go into the Sacred Tent and find out what Yahweh says about it.”
\p
\v 9 So \add Moses/I went into the tent and asked Yahweh what I should tell thepeople\add*, and this is what Yahweh said:
\v 10 “Tell this to the Israeli people: If any of you or your descendants touch a corpse and as a result become unacceptable tome, or if you are away from home on a long trip \add at the time to celebrate thePassover\add*, you will still be permitted to celebrate it.
\v 11 But you must celebrate it exactly one month later, early in the evening of the fourteenth day of that month. Eat the meat of the lamb for the Passover Festival with bread that is baked without yeast and eat bitter herbs.
\v 12 Do not leave any of it until the next morning. And do not break any of the lamb's bones. Obey all the regulations about celebrating the Passover.
\v 13 But if any of you has not done anything that would make you unfit to celebrate the Passover Festival, and you are not away from home on a long trip, and you do not sacrifice to me at the proper time, you will no longer be allowed to associate with my people. ◄You will be punished/I will punish you►.
\p
\v 14 Foreigners who live among you may also celebrate the Passover Festival, if they obey all my commands concerning it.”
\s1 A cloud covered the Sacred Tent
\p
\v 15-16 On the day that the Sacred Tent was set up, a cloud covered it. But from the time that the sun set until the time thatthe sun rose \add the next day\add*, the cloud resembled a \add huge\add* fire. And that is what happened every day\add that we Israelis were in the desert\add*
\v 17 When the cloud rose up and started to move \add to a new location\add*, the Israelis followed it. When the cloud stopped, the Israelis stopped there and set up their tents.
\v 18 We traveled when Yahweh, \add by causing the cloud to move orstop\add*, told them when to move and when to stop. When the cloud stayed over the Sacred Tent, we Israelis stayed at that place.
\v 19 Sometimes the cloud stayed over the tent for a long time, so when that happened, we did not travel.
\v 20 Sometimes the cloud remained over the tent for only a few days. The people stopped and set up their tents as Yahwehcommanded them, and we traveled\add to a new location\add* when Yahweh commanded them to do that.
\v 21 Sometimes the cloud stayed in one place for only one day. When that happened, when the cloud rose up\add into the sky\add* the next morning, then we traveled. Whenever the cloud moved, during the day or during the night, we traveled.
\v 22 If the cloud stayed over the Sacred Tent for two days, or for a month, or for a year, during that time we stayed where we were. But when the cloud rose up into the sky, they started to travel.
\v 23 When Yahweh commanded us to \add stop and\add* set up their tents, they did that. When he told them to move, they moved. We did whatever Yahweh told Moses/me that they should do.
