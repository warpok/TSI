\c 23
\s1 Balaam blessed the Israeli people
\p
\v 1 Bileam berkata kepada Balak, "Dirikan bagiku di sini tujuh mezbah dan bawakan kepadaku tujuh ekor lembu jantan dan tujuh ekor domba jantan."
\v 2 Balak melakukan seperti yang dikatakan Bileam. Kemudian mereka mempersembahkan seekor lembu jantan dan seekor domba jantan di setiap mezbah.
\p
\v 3 Sesudah itu Bileam berkata kepada Barah, "Berdirilah dekat kurban bakaranmu itu. Aku akan pergi, mungkin TUHAN datang menemui aku, apapun perkataan yang disampikan-Nya kepadaku, akan kuberitahukan kepadamu. Lalu pergilah Bileam ke atas sebuah bukit,
\v 4 dan di sana Allah menemui Bileam. Lalu Bileam berkata, "Saya sudah mendirikan tujuh mezbah dan mempersembahkan seekor lembu jantan dan seekor domba jantan di setiap mezbah itu.”
\p
\v 5 Lalu TUHAN memberitahukan kepada Bileam apa yang harus dia katakan kepada Balak. Sesudah itu
\p
\v 6 When Balaam returned to Balak, Balak was standing with the leaders from Moab beside the offerings he had burned\add on the altar\add*.
\v 7 This is the message that Balaam told them:
\q1 “Balak summoned me to come here from Syria;
\q2 the king of Moab brought me here from the hills at the eastern side of Syria.
\q1 He said, ‘Come and curse the descendants of Jacob for me!
\q2 Come and say that bad things will happen to these Israeli people!’
\q1
\v 8 But ◄how can I curse people whom God has not cursed?/I certainly cannot curse people whom God has not cursed!► [RHQ]
\q1 ◄How can I condemn people whom Yahweh has not condemned?/I cannot condemn people whom Yahweh has not condemned!► [RHQ]
\q1
\v 9 I have seen them from the tops of the rocky peaks,
\q2 I have seen them from the hills.
\q1 I see that they are a group of people who live by themselves.
\q2 They have separated themselves from (OR, they are not like) other nations.
\q1
\v 10 ◄Who can count the descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous as particles of ‘dust/dirt’?/No one can count the descendants of Jacob; they are as numerous as particles of ‘dust/dirt’!► [RHQ]
\q1 ◄Who can count even a quarter of the Israeli people?/No one can count even a quarter of the Israeli people!► [RHQ]
\q1 I wish/hope that I will die like righteous people die;
\q2 I hope that I will die \add peacefully\add* like they will die.”
\p
\v 11 Then Balak said, “What have you done to me [RHQ]? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but instead you have ◄blessed them/asked Yahweh to bless them►!”
\p
\v 12 But Balaam replied, “I can [RHQ] say only what Yahweh tells me to say. I cannot say anything else.”
\s1 Balaam prophesied about the Israelis again
\p
\v 13 Then King Balak told Balaam, “Come with me to another place. There you will see only part of the Israeli people, and you will be able to curse those people for me.”
\v 14 So Balak took Balaam to a field on the top of Pisgah Mountain. There, again he built seven altars and offered a youngbull and a ram \add as a sacrifice\add* on each altar.
\p
\v 15 Then Balaam said to the king, “Stand here close to your burned offerings, while I go and talk with Yahweh.”
\p
\v 16 So Balaam did that, and Yahweh appeared to Balaam again and gave him another message. Then he said, “Go back to Balak and tell him that message.”
\p
\v 17 So Balaam returned to where the king and the leaders from Moab were standing, next to the altar where Balak had burned the sacrifices. Balak asked him, “What did Yahweh say?”
\p
\v 18 Then Balaam told him this message:
\q1 “Balak, listen carefully;
\q2 hear what I have to say, you son of Zippor [DOU]!
\q1
\v 19 God is not a human being.
\q2 Humans lie, but God never lies.
\q1 He never changes his mind/thoughts, as humans do.
\q1 Whatever he has said that he will do, he does.
\q1 Whatever he has promised to do, he has [RHQ] done it.
\q1
\v 20 He commanded me \add to request him\add* to bless \add theIsraelis\add*,
\q2 So he has blessed them, and I cannot change that.
\b
\q1
\v 21 Yahweh their God is with/helping them;
\q2 they have declared that he is their true king.
\q1 So the descendants of Jacob will not be harmed;
\q2 they will not have any troubles [DOU].
\q1
\v 22 God brought them out from \add being slaves\add* in Egypt;
\q2 he is as strong as a wild ox.
\q1
\v 23 When people curse [PRS] the descendants of Jacob, they will not be harmed;
\q2 when people work sorcery on them, it will have no power.
\q1 So now people will say about the descendants of Jacob,
\q2 ‘God has done wonderful things for the Israelis!’
\q1
\v 24 They are very strong, like lionesses that are ready to attack\add other animals\add*;
\q2 they stand firm like lions.
\q1 The lions refuse to rest until they have \add killed and\add* eaten their prey,
\q2 and drunk the blood of the animals they slaughtered.”
\p
\v 25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “If you will not curse them, then\add I certainly\add* do not \add want you\add* to bless them!”
\p
\v 26 But Balaam replied, “I told you that I must do only what Yahweh tells me to do!”
\s1 Balaam prophesied about the Israelis a third time
\p
\v 27 Then King Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to allow you to curse them from that place.”
\v 28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor Mountain where they could look down\add and see the Israelis in\add* the desert.
\p
\v 29 Balaam again told Balak, “Build me seven altars again and kill seven young bulls and seven rams\add for a sacrifice\add*.”
\v 30 So Balak did what Balaam told him to do. He burned a young bull and a ram on each altar as sacrifices.
