\s1 Anak-anak Harun
\p
\v 1 Inilah catatan keturunan Harun dan saya ketika TUHAN berfirman kepada saya di Gunung Sinai.
\p
\v 2 Harun memiliki empat orang anak laki-laki. Yang sulung bernama Nadab, kemudian Abihu, Eleazar, and Itamar.
\v 3 Saya mentahbiskan mereka/mengangkat mereka sebagai imam-imam dan dikhususkan untuk melayani di Kemah Suci.
\v 4 Akan tetapi TUHAN melenyapkan Nadab da Abihu di padang gurun Sinai ketika mereka melakukan upacara pembakaran kepada TUHAN dengan cara yang salah/tidak sesuai kepada TUHAN. Mereka berdua tidak memiliki keturunan, maka Eleazar dan Itamar yang melayani sebagai imam selama masa hidup bapak mereka, Harun.
\p
\v 5 Lalu berfirmanlah TUHAN kepada saya,
\v 6 “Bawalah orang-orang suku Lewi dan di dalam hadirat-Nya, mereka diserahkan dihadapan Harun sebagai Imam kepala, untuk dapat melayaninya.
\v 7 Mereka bertugas untuk melayani apa yang dibutuhkan Harun dan juga kebutuhan seluruh lapisan masyarakat Israel yang berkaitan dengan pelayanan di Kemah suci/kemah pertemuan.
\v 8 Mereka juga bertanggung jawab atas semua perlengkapan Kemah Pertemuan/Suci dan melayani di Kemah Suci dengan cara membantu dan menyiapkan apa yang dibutuhkan bangsa Israel saat beribadah.
\v 9 Kamu harus menugaskan orang-orang Lewi secara khusus kepada Harun dan kedua anaknya dari antara semua bangsa Israel.
\v 10 Kamu harus menugaskan Harun dan kedua anaknya untuk melakasanakan tugas dan tanggung jawab mereka sebagai Imam. Apabila ada orang lain yang tidak berkewenangan atau berkepentingan yang mendekati Kemah Suci, maka orang itu harus dibunuh.
\p
\v 11 Berfirmanlah TUHAN kepada saya,
\v 12 “Perhatikanlah dengan seksama, Aku telah mengambil suku Lewi dari antara kalian sebagai pengganti anak sulung, maka suku Lewi sepenuhnya milik-Ku. from all the Israelis, I have chosen the men of the tribe of Levi to take the places of all the firstborn sons of the Israeli people. The male descendants of Levi belong to me,
\v 13 because truly all the firstborn \add males\add* belong to me. That is because on the day that I killed all the firstborn\add sons\add* of the people of Egypt, I \add spared\add* all the firstborn\add sons\add* of the Israelis and set them apart for myself. I also set apart the firstborn\add males\add* of your domestic animals. They belong to me, Yahweh.”
\p
\v 14 Yahweh spoke to Moses/me again in the Sinai Desert. He said,
\v 15 “Count the male members of the tribe of Levi. Write down their names and the names of their clans and family groups. Count all the males who are at least one month old.”
\v 16 So Moses/I counted them, just as Yahweh commanded.
\li1
\v 17 Levi had \add three\add* sons, whose names were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\li1
\v 18 Gershon had \add two\add* sons, Libni and Shimei. The clans that were descended from them had the same names as those\add two\add* sons.
\li1
\v 19 Kohath had \add four\add* sons, Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. The clans that were descended from them had the samenames as those \add four\add* sons.
\li1
\v 20 Merari had \add two\add* sons, Mahli and Mushi. The clans that were descended from them had the same names as those\add two\add* sons.
\li1 Those are the clans that were descended from Levi.
\b
\p
\v 21 The two clans descended from Gershon are those that were descended from\add his sons\add* Libni and Shimei.
\v 22 In those two clans there were 7,500 males who were at least one month old.
\v 23 They were told to set up their tents on the west side of the Sacred Tent.
\v 24 The leader of those two clans was Eliasaph, the son of Lael.
\v 25 Their work was to take care of the Sacred Tent, including the coverings of the tent, the curtain at the entrance of the tent,
\v 26 the ◄curtains/large pieces of cloth► that formed the walls around the courtyard that is around the tent and around the altar, the curtains that were at the entrance of the courtyard, and the ropes\add for fastening the tent\add*. They also did all the work of taking care of the things outside the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 27 The clans that were descended from Kohath were those descended from his sons Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
\v 28 In those four clans there were 8,600 males who were at least one month old. The work of the men of the clans was to takecare of the \add things that are inside\add* the Sacred Tent.
\v 29 They set up their tents on the south side of the Sacred Tent.
\v 30 The leader of those four clans was Elizaphan, the son of Uzziel.
\v 31 The work of the men of those clans was to take care of the sacred chest, the table\add on which the priest put the sacred bread\add*, the lampstand, the altars, all the items that the priest used in the Sacred Tent, and the curtain that is inside the tent. Their work was also to take care of the things inside the tent.
\p
\v 32 Aaron's son Eleazar was the leader of all the male descendants of Levi. He supervised all the work that was done at the Sacred Tent.
\p
\v 33 The clans that were descended from Merari were those descended from\add his sons\add* Mahli and Mushi.
\v 34 In those two clans there were 6,200 males who were at least one month old.
\v 35 They were told to set up their tents on the north side of the Sacred Tent. The leader of those two clans was Zuriel, the son of Abihail.
\v 36 The work of the men of those two clans was to take care of the frames that held up the tent, the crossbars, the pillars, and the bases. They also did all the work that was connected with those items.
\v 37 Their work was also to take care of the posts \add that held up the curtains that formed the wallsof\add* the courtyard, and all the bases, tent pegs, and ropes \add that fastened thosecurtains\add*.
\p
\v 38 Aaron and Moses/I and Aaron's sons were told to set up their/our tents in the area in front of the Sacred Tent, on the east side. Their/Our work was to supervise the work that would be done in and around the Sacred Tent, for the benefit of theIsraeli people. Only the priests were permitted to do that. \add Yahweh declaredthat\add* we should execute anyone else who went near the tent \add to do the work that the priestsdo\add*.
\p
\v 39 When Aaron and Moses/I counted all the males who were at least one month old, who belonged to the clans descended from Levi, the total was 22,000.
\b
\p
\v 40 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me, “Now count all the \add other\add* firstborn males in Israel who are at least one month old, and write down their names.
\v 41 Also, set apart for me the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn males of the other Israelis. And set apart for me the livestock of the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the other Israeli people.”
\p
\v 42 So Moses/I did that. He/I counted the firstborn males of all the Israeli people, as Yahweh had commanded.
\v 43 The total of those who were at least one month old was 22,273.
\p
\v 44 Then Yahweh said to Moses/me,
\v 45 “Set apart the descendants of Levi to be substitutes for the\add firstborn males of\add* the other Israeli people. The descendants of Levi belong to me, Yahweh.
\v 46 There are 273 more firstborn males of the other Israeli people than of the descendants of Levi.
\v 47-48 To pay for these 273 males, collect five pieces of silver for each of them. Each of those pieces of silver must weigh the same as each of the silver coins that are stored in the Sacred Tent. Give this silver to Aaron and his sons.”
\p
\v 49 So Moses/I did that. He/I collected the silver from those 273 males.
\v 50 The total was 1,365 pieces of silver. Each silver coin weighed the same as each of the silver coins stored in the Sacred Tent.
\v 51 Moses/I gave these silver coins to Aaron and his sons, as Yahweh had commanded.
