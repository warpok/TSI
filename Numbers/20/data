\c 20
\s1 Air yang mengalir dari batu
\p
\v 1 Pada bulan pertama kalendar Yahudi atau di antara bulan Maret dan April di tahun berikutnya, bangsa Israel mencapai Padang Pasir Zin dan berkemah di dekat Kades. Di tempat ini Miriam meninggal dan dikuburkan.
\p
\v 2 Di tempat itu tidak ada air yang dapat diminum, sehingga bangsa Israel datang menghadap Musa dan Harun.
\v 3 Mereka menggerutu terhadap Musa dan berkata, “Seandainya saja kami juga binasa seperti saudara-saudara kami yang lain!
\v 4 Mengapa kalian membawa umat TUHAN ke padang gurun ini? Apa kalian hendak membunuh kami dan ternak kami?
\v 5 Mengapa kalian membawa kami keluar dari Mesir ke tempat yang mengerikan ini? Tempat ini tidak ada gandum, buah ara, buah anggur ataupun delima, bahkan tidak ada air untuk kami minum!”
\p
\v 6 Harun dan Musa pergi dari hadapan orang-orang itu dan menuju ke pintu masuk Kemah Suci dan berdoa. Kemuliaan TUHAN muncul di hadapan mereka,
\v 7 dan TUHAN berkata kepada Musa,
\v 8 “Kumpulkanlah orang-orang itu bersama dengan engkau dan Harun, dan bawalah serta tongkat Harun. Di hadapan orang-orang itu, ketika mereka sedang memperhatikan engkau, pukullah batu besar yang ada di sebelah sana, dan batu itu akan mengeluarkan air. Air itu akan cukup untuk memuaskan rasa haus mereka dan juga ternak mereka.”
\p
\v 9 So Moses/I did what Yahweh told him/me to do. He/I took Aaron's walking-stick from the place in the Sacred Tent where it was kept.
\v 10 Then Aaron and he/I summoned all the people to gather at the rock. Then Moses/I shouted to them, “All you rebellious people, listen! Is it necessary for us to bring to you water from this rock?”
\v 11 Then Moses/I raised his/my hand and \add instead of speaking to therock\add*, he/I struck the rock two times with the walking stick. And water gushed/poured out. So all the people and their livestock drank all the water that they wanted.
\p
\v 12 But Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me, “You did not believe that I could demonstrate my power to the Israeli people\add and give them water without your striking the rock\add*. So you will not lead them into the land that I am giving to them!”
\p
\v 13 Later this place was called Meribah, \add which means 'arguing'\add*, because there the Israeli people argued againstYahweh, and there he showed his power to them \add by giving them\add* water.
\s1 The king of Edom refused to allow the Israelis to travel through his country
\p
\v 14 \add While the people were\add* at Kadesh \add town\add*, Moses/I sent messengers to the king of Edom to tell him this:
\pi1 “Your relatives, the Israeli people, are sending you this message. You know the many troubles/hardships that have happened to us.
\v 15 You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt. You know that they stayed there for many years. They suffered because the\add rulers of\add* Egypt caused them to become their slaves \add and to work veryhard\add*.
\pi1
\v 16 But when they called out to Yahweh, he heard them and sent an angel who brought them out of Egypt. Now we have set up our tents here at Kadesh, a town at the border of your land.
\v 17 Please allow us to travel through your country. We will \add be carefulto\add* not walk through your fields and your vineyards. We will not even drink water from your wells. As we travel, we willstay on the king's highway, \add the main road that goes from the south to thenorth\add*, and we will not leave that road until we have crossed the border\add of your country in the north\add*.”
\p
\v 18 But the king of Edom refused. He replied, “Stay out of my country! If you try\add to enter it\add*, I will \add send my army to\add* attack you!”
\p
\v 19 The Israeli messengers replied, “\add If we travel through yourcountry\add*, we will stay on the main road. If we and any of our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We want only to travel through your country. We do not want anything else.”
\p
\v 20 But the king replied, “No! Stay out of our country! We will not\add allow you\add* to travel through our land!” Then he sent the strongest soldiers in his army to prevent the Israelis\add from entering his country\add*.
\p
\v 21 So, because \add the king of\add* Edom refused to allow the Israelis to travel through his country, the Israelis turned\add and traveled a different way\add*.
\s1 Aaron died
\p
\v 22 The Israeli people left Kadesh. They went to Hor Mountain,
\v 23 which is at the border of Edom. While they were there, Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses/me,
\v 24 “It is time for Aaron to die [EUP]. He will not enter the land that I am giving to you Israelis, because the two of youdisobeyed me \add when I told you to speak to the rock to cause\add* the water\add to flow\add* at Meribah.
\v 25 Now you, Moses, take Aaron and his son Eleazar up on Hor Mountain.
\v 26 There you must remove Aaron's clothes \add that he wears when he does the works of apriest\add*, and put them on his son, Eleazar. Aaron will die up there.”
\p
\v 27 So Moses/I did what Yahweh commanded. The three of them/us climbed up Hor Mountain, while all the Israeli people watched.
\v 28 At the top of the mountain, Moses/I took off the clothes that Aaron wore\add while he did the work of a priest\add* and put them on Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Eleazar and Moses/I went back down.
\v 29 When the Israeli people realized that Aaron had died, they all mourned for him for thirty days.
