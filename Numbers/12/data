\c 12
\s1 Miryam dan Harun [melawan//menentang] Musa
\s1 Miriam and Aaron were jealous of Moses
\p
\v 1-2 Miryam dan Harun berbicara [melawan//menentang] Musa. Mereka [melawan//menentang] dia karena dia menikah dengan perempuan Kush. Miryam dan Harun dalam percakapan mereka berdua, "Apakah TUHAN berfirman hanya melalui Musa? Bukankah TUHAN berfirman melalui kita juga?" TUHAN mendengar percakapan mereka itu.
\p Moses'/My \add older sister\add* Miriam and his/my \add olderbrother\add* Aaron were saying this: “Is Moses the only one to whom Yahweh has spoken messages to tell to us [RHQ]? Does Yahwehnot speak messages to us two also?” \add They told people that\add* they were saying that because Moses/I had married a womanwho was a descendant of the Cush people-group, \add but they were really saying that because they ◄were jealous/did not wantMoses/me to be the only leader of the Israeli people►\add*. But Yahweh heard what they were saying.
\p
\v 3 Musa adalah seorang yang sangat rendah hati, melebihi semua orang di dunia. \add The truth was that\add* Moses/I was very humble. He/I was more humble than anyone else on the earth\add and Moses/I had not appointed himself/myself to be their leader\add*.
\p
\v 4 Tiba-tiba TUHAN berbicara kepada Musa, Harun dan Miryam, "Kalian bertiga, datanglah ke Rumah-Ku." Mereka pun datang ke Rumah TUHAN.
\p So immediately Yahweh spoke to Moses/me and to Aaron and Miriam. He said, “All three of you must go and stand at the Sacred Tent.” So they/we did that.
\v 5 Kemudian TUHAN turun dalam tiang awan. TUHAN berdiri di pintu Rumah-Nya dan memanggil Harun serta Miryam. Mereka berdua datang mendekat dengan TUHAN.Then Yahweh descended to the entrance of the tent in a cloud\add that resembled a huge white\add* pillar. He told Aaron and Miriam to step forward, so they did.
\v 6 Lalu TUHAN berbicara kepada mereka,
\p Then he said to them,
\q1 "Dengarkanlah perkataan-Ku ini!
\q1 “Listen to me!
\q1 Apabila di antara kalian ada seorang nabi,
\q1 When a prophet is among you,
\q1 Aku menyatakan diri-Ku kepadanya dalam penglihatan-penglihatan,
\q1 I \add usually\add* reveal myself to him by allowing him to see visions,
\q1 dan berbicara dengan dia dalam mimpi.
\q1 and I speak to him in dreams.
\q1
\v 7 Bukan demikian hamba-Ku Musa. Aku sudah menjadikan dia pemimpin atas seluruh umat-Ku.
\q1 But that is not the way I speak to my servant Moses.
\q2 I trust that he will lead my people \add well\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Dan Aku berbicara dengan dia berhadapan muka dengan jelas, terus terang, dan melihat rupa-Ku sebagai TUHAN. Mengapa kalian berani melawan hamba-Ku Musa?"So I talk to him face-to-face.
\q2 I speak to him ◄clearly/using words that he will understand easily►, not using parables.
\q2 He has even seen what I look like.
\q2 So you should be afraid to criticize my servant Moses!”
\p
\v 9 TUHAN sangat marah kepada Miryam dan Harun, karena itu, Dia meninggalkan mereka.Yahweh was very angry with Miriam and Aaron, and he left.
\p
\v 10 Ketika tiang awan meninggalkan Rumah TUHAN, Harun melihat Miryam kena penyakit kusta. Kulitnya menjadi putih seperti kapas.When the cloud rose up from the Sacred Tent, Aaron looked at Miriam, and he saw that her skin was\add as white\add* as snow, because she now had leprosy.
\v 11 Harun berbicara kepada Musa, "Tuanku, tolonglah kami! Janganlah biarkan kami tersiksa karena dosa yang kami buat dalam kebodohan kami.Aaron said to Moses/me, “My master, please do not punish us for this sin that we have foolishly committed.
\v 12 Janganlah biarkan Miryam menjadi seperti bayi yang baru lahir dalam keadaan sudah mati, karena dagingnya setengah busuk."Do not allow Miriam to be like a baby that is already dead when it is born, whose flesh is already half decayed!”
\p
\v 13 Maka Musa berdoa kepada TUHAN, "Ya Allah, aku mohon kepada-Mu, sembuhkanlah dia!"
\p So Moses/I cried out to Yahweh, saying, “God, I plead with you to heal her!”
\p
\v 14 TUHAN menjawab Musa, "Apabila ayahnya meludahi mukanya, dia pasti merasa malu selama 7 hari. Kucilkan dia 7 hari lamanya tinggal di luar perkemahan. Sesudah itu, dia boleh kembali lagi."
\p But Yahweh replied, “If her father had \add rebuked her for doing something wrongby\add* spitting in her face, she would have been ashamed for seven days.\add She should be ashamed because of what she has done\add*. So send her outside the camp for seven days. Then\add she will not have leprosy anymore, and\add* she may return to the camp.”
\v 15 Lalu Miryam dikucilkan di luar perkemahan selama 7 hari. Orang Israel tidak melanjutkan perjalanan ke daerah lain sampai Miryam kembali ke perkemahan.So they sent her outside the camp for seven days. ◄The people/We► did not move\add to another location\add* until she returned.
\p
\v 16 Setelah Miryam diijinkan kembali ke perkemahan, maka orang Israel meninggalkan Hazerot dan berkemah dipadang gurun Paran.But after \add she returned\add*, they/we left Hazeroth and moved\add north\add* in the Paran Desert and set up their/our tents there.
